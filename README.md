# lich-projects
Main branch holding all my dr_lich project files

This repository is setup to hold my custom lich scripts and YAML files for transfer between computers.  It supports my own charactes and those of my family.

The main file associations are
-  YAML files, used in the dependancy DR fork of lich as settings files for character and script controll.
-  .lic files are RUBY formated files with the .lic extension for use in the lich scripting engine
